- Zero cross-user data contamination

### **Auto-Save Strategy**
```typescript
// Immediate save on every portfolio action:
const savePortfolio = async (stocks) => {
  const response = await portfolioAPI.savePortfolio(stocks, 'My Portfolio');
  setCurrentPortfolioId(response.data.portfolioId);
  setPortfolioSaved(true); // Ready for analysis
};
```

### **Analysis Persistence**
- AI analysis results saved to `recommendations` table
- Analysis events logged in `analyticsEvent` table
